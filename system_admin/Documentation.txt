     ********Cinema Seat Reservation Concept:**************

Every cinema have a seats which going to be reserved by the customer
so those seats are reserved by the customer, only if  there is a movie to be 
shown in the cinema(meaning that every seat should have MovieShow object so the will create MovieShowseat Object). 

When a cinema adds a movie to show there will be a whole cinema seats to be reserved.
a seat will be in one of the two states  " 1. RESERVED OR 2. FREE " .

  1. when the seat is reserved it may be in one of two cases:
    1.1, the reserve may be parmanent :- which means that the customer paid the ticket fee
    1.2, the reserve may be temporary :- which means the customer reserved but unable to pay in the provided time limit

 In the case provided in 1.1 the seat for will not be aviliable for other customers the who paid owns this seat of the entire show.
 In the case provided in  1.2 the seat will be free again and another customer can book for the seat
  
  2. whin the seat is free. it means there is no active request of customer to book for the seat so it is open for customers
